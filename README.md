# LandingPage
A simple project landing page.

Reflection:
Aligning items within the flexbox was a bit challenging. I need to practice more with flexboxes within flexboxes. I think I can streamline the CSS more but I'm not sure how yet.

I also tried to make it responsive for mobile devices but it is still a little challenging for me at this stage so that will be my next step.
